My first Notebook on Data with Python
===============
I will be exploring [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), since it's the one I have been recommended for quite some time now. I am choosing this over R mainly because I do not require the data visualization part that it gives you. I intend to do the data visualization part later with D3.js. In any case, this will document my experiences learning Python.
### I also found this amazing resource
