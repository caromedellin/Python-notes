## Usage - Running Jupyter notebook

### Running in a local installation

Launch with:

    $ jupyter notebook
###The Code Cell
The Code Cell is a markdown cell 
So basically you can run code within markdown and it's awesome! I seriously can't believe it! It is amazing! They are also about learning stuff. the way that you learn is that if you hit tab you get every single function that starts with whatever you put before!
Tab inside the () two times gives you all the doc for the python function. 
And you can also share this, you can use notebook convert
    
    $ notebook
