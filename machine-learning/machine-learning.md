##What is Machine Learning? 
There are two main definitions of Machine Learning are offered. Arthur Samuel described it as: “the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed (this is an older definition).
Tom Mitchell provides a more modern definition. “A computer is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T is measured by P, improves with experience E”.
```
Example: playing checkers.

E = the experience of playing many games of checkers
T = the task of playing checkers
P = the probability that the program will win the next game.
