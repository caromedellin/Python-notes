* [Pandas](https://github.com/caromedellin/Python-notes/blob/master/pandas.pyc)
  <br> Imported Pandas to play with it.
* [Chapter 1: Reading from a CSV Pandas cookbook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jvns/pandas-cookbook/blob/master/cookbook/Chapter%201%20-%20Reading%20from%20a%20CSV.ipynb)
  <br> Reading your data into pandas is pretty much the easiest thing. Even when the encoding is wrong!

Compilation of notes from the Standford class given by Andrew Ng and other miscellaneous resources.

##What is Machine Learning? 
There are two main definitions of Machine Learning are offered. Arthur Samuel described it as: “the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed (this is an older definition).
Tom Mitchell provides a more modern definition. “A computer is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T is measured by P, improves with experience E”.
```
Example: playing checkers.

E = the experience of playing many games of checkers
T = the task of playing checkers
P = the probability that the program will win the next game.
```
Machine Learning grew out of work in AI and it's a new capability for computers. Learning Algorithms can touch many problems. My personal interests are in Natural Language Processing, Database mining and self customizing programs.

As explained in the course by Andrew Ng, Machine Learning can be supervised and unsupervised.

## Supervised Learning
======================

In supervised Learning we are given a data set and we already know what to expect from it, this means that we know what the correct output should look like. There is already an idea that there is a relationship between the input and the output.
The supervised learning problems are categorized in "regression" and "classification" problems.
